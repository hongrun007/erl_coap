CoAP (partial) library for Erlang
==========================

This library implements (as of today) only one of the [CoAP methods](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-18), the GET method, using [CantCoAP](https://github.com/staropram/cantcoap) as a serialization library for the C driver.
